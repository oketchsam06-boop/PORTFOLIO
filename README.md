# Portfolio (updated)

This repository contains a simple, modern single-page portfolio for Samuel Oketch.

What I changed
- Converted the original inline styles to `styles.css`.
- Added `scripts.js` for theme toggle, mobile nav, modal and contact demo handling.
- Added `manifest.json` and meta tags for better SEO and PWA readiness.

How to view locally

1. Start a simple static server from the repository root (Python 3):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000

# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Notes
- Replace files in `/assets` (profile image, project screenshots, icons) with your real images.
- Update project card links to point to live demos or repo URLs.
- Configure a form backend (or use a service like Formspree) if you want the contact form to send real emails.
